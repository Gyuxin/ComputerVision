Write a program that finds Canny edges in the file tracks.jpg, and then finds lines in these edges using the Hough transform. The easiest way to do this is to take the programs edge.cpp and houghlines.cpp that are in the assignment files and then combine them. The key parameter in edge detection is the edge threshold which can be varied by the track bar as in edge.cpp (the other parameters worked fine for me). Then for a given edge threshold find the lines in the resulting edges using the Hough transform. Then draw these lines in the image as is done in the program houghlines.cpp. Again, the Hough parameters in houghlines.cpp worked well for me. The goal is to have as output an image similar to detected track_lines.jpg, with between two and ten detected lines (no more or less). You should submit your software along with the final output image. This is an exercise in adjusting the Canny and Hough transform parameters to give the desired results.
